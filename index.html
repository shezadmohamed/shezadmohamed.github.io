<p>I am a PhD student of Omar Leo&#769n Sa&#769nchez interested in the model theory, algebra, and geometry of
fields and differential fields. My most recent work has been on establishing results
about the existence of model companion for various theories of fields with free operators, as well as about
neo-stability theoretic properties transferred from the underlying field to the field with operators.

    Neostability transfers in derivation-like theories</a> (with Omar Leo&#769n Sa&#769nchez).
    <br>
    Submitted for publication.
    <a href="papers/derivation-like.pdf">pdf</a>,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11248">arXiv</a>.
  </summary>
  <p>
    Motivated by structural properties of differential field extensions, we
    introduce the notion of a theory T being derivation-like with respect to
    another model-complete theory T&#x2080. We prove that when T admits a
    model-companion T&#x208A, then several model-theoretic properties transfer
    from T&#x2080 to T&#x208A. These properties include completeness,
    quantifier-elimination, stability, simplicity, and NSOP&#x2081. We also
    observe that, aside from the theory of differential fields, examples of
    derivation-like theories are plentiful.

  <summary>
    The uniform companion for fields with free operators in characteristic zero.
    <br>
    Accepted for publication in the <i>Journal of the London Mathematical
      Society</i>.
      <a href="papers/uc.pdf">pdf</a>,
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01856">arXiv</a>.
  </summary>
  <p>
    Generalising the uniform companion for large fields with a single
    derivation, we construct a theory UC&#x1D49F of fields of
    characteristic 0 with free operators – operators determined by a homomorphism from the
    field to its tensor product with &#x1D49F, a finite-dimensional
    &rationals;-algebra – which is the model companion of any theory of a field
    with free operators whose associated difference field is difference
    large and model complete. Under the assumption that &#x1D49F is a local ring,
    we show that simplicity is transferred from the theory of the underlying
    field to the theory of the field with operators, and we use this to study
    the model theory of bounded, PAC fields with free operators.

    The Weil descent functor in the category of algebras with free operators.
    <br>
    <i>Journal of Algebra</i>, 640:216&ndash;252, 2024.
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2023.10.029">doi</a>,
    <a href="papers/d-weil-descent.pdf">pdf</a>,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09546">arXiv</a>.
  </summary>
  <p>
    We prove that there exists a version of Weil descent, or Weil restriction,
    in the category of &#x1D49F-algebras. The objects of this category
    are k-algebras R equipped with a homomorphism e : R &#x2192 R &#x2297&#x2096
    &#x1D49F for some fixed field k and finite-dimensional k-algebra &#x1D49F.
    We do this under a mild assumption on the so-called associated
    endomorphisms. In particular, this yields the existence of the Weil descent
    functor in the category of difference algebras, which, to our knowledge,
    does not appear elsewhere.

  <p>
    We show that fields with free operators (in the sense of Moosa and
    Scanlon's <q>Model theory of fields with free operators in characteristic
    zero</q>) whose operators pairwise commute can be seen as an instance of
    iterative <u>&#x1D49F</u>-rings (in the sense of the same
    authors' <q>Generalised Hasse–Schmidt varieties and their jet spaces</q>).
